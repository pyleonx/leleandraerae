      <h1>Dear Love,</h1>

Happy 8 months, Rae Rae ðŸ§¡

When I close my eyes and think of us, I go straight back to that moment in June, your hand in mine, the two of us sitting by the Singapore River, talking softly as the city lights danced around us. That memory lives in me like a promise. It reminds me of what weâ€™ve already built, are building, and what we are fighting for, and the quiet power of simply being with you.

Eight months may not seem like long to the world, but to me, itâ€™s everything, I've never been in such a close relationship with anyone for 8 months. Every memory weâ€™ve created, each smile, each deep conversation, each shared silence, each goofy cringy ahh moment,  even the sad moments, has been a thread that ties my eyes to yours, my heart to yours. From the little things like your laugh when we joke about nonsense (being dumbdumb), to the bigger things like talking about our future, I carry them all with me. They make me want to be better, not just for you, but for us.

And now, despite all our fights and heartbreaking moments, as we step into this next chapter, I want to make you a new promise and do all I can to keep it:  
-That I will be consistent, present and steady.  
-That my love will not just be something you hear, but something you feel in every part of your day.  
-That I will show up for you, not in bursts of emotion, but in the small, quiet ways that build trust and safety over time. Not just sometimes, but every day.

Iâ€™m excited about everything thatâ€™s ahead. I canâ€™t stop thinking about August, about you coming over, about going on big dates and late-night talks and staycations where we forget the rest of the world for a while. I want us to dress up (imma better my style i promise), go to fun parties, explore new places and eats, laugh until our cheeks hurt, and build even more memories that weâ€™ll look back on years from now with full hearts.

You are my best thing, and I never want you to forget that. Not for a second.  
I love you, I believe in us, and Iâ€™m committedâ€”fullyâ€”to growing into the man you can lean on.

Hereâ€™s to us, where weâ€™ve been, where we are now, and everything weâ€™re becoming.  
Happy 8 months, my love.

Yours, always,  
LeLe
